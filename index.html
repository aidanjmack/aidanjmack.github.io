                    Who I Am
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be graduating at the end of 2022 with a Bachelor of Media majoring in Design and Interactivity.
                    I am a 27 year old digital designer and developer currently in my last year of study at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before deciding to re-skill as a digital designer I worked in live audio production - where I honed my creative, technical and communication skills as a PA System Technician and Audio Engineer, 
                    working with international music acts and large corporate clients on world class events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I live and breathe technology as an Information Systems Support Specialist while sharpening both my design and devolopment skills in and out of university.

                <h2>
                    What I Do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I focus on creating user experiences and digital objects that are responsive, accessible and highly usable. 
                    With plenty of planning, user research and testing I aim to design with empathy and create products that are as satisfying to interact with as they are to look at. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my focus is on UX/UI and front end design and devlopement for the web and applications I can hold my own on the back end too. 
                    As well as this I have significant experience in audio recording and production as well as being a decent copy writer, photographer and video editor.
                </p>
