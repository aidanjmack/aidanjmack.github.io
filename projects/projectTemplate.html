                <p>
                    I focus on creating user experiences and digital objects that are responsive, accessible and highly usable. 
                    With plenty of planning, user research and testing I aim to design with empathy and create products that are as satisfying to interact with as they are to look at. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my focus is on UX/UI and front end design and devlopement for the web and applications I can hold my own on the back end too. 
                    As well as this I have significant experience in audio recording and production as well as being a decent copy writer, photographer and video editor.
